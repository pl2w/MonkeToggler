## Making your mod compatible
To make your mod compatible with MonkeToggler, you must add ```OnEnable()``` and ```OnDisable()``` methods into your BaseUnityPlugin file.
```cs
using BepInEx;

namespace ExampleMod
{
    [BepInPlugin("pl2w.examplemod", "ExampleMod", "1.0.0")]
    public class Plugin : BaseUnityPlugin
    {
        void OnEnable()
        {
             Debug.Log("This gets called when your mod gets enabled, or when the mod is first initialized.");
        }

        void OnDisable()
        {
            Debug.Log("This gets called when your mod gets disabled.");
        }
    }
}

```
